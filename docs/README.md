# About

## What

An opinionated PHP micro-framework to build modular applications.

## Why

This project originally started as a learning exercise to learn the intricacies of framework development. I then started using it for the [Sushi ERP](https://github.com/domynation/sushi-erp/) project, which over time grew big enough to justify spending more time and energy on polishing this framework.

## Installing

### Requirements

* PHP &gt;=7.4
* cURL

### Installation via composer

```bash
composer require domynation/domynation-framework
```
